Sometimes called list, organizes items sequentially.

| index | data   |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | Cat    |
| 1     | Mouse  |
| 2     | Dog    |
| 3     | Parrot |

| operation | BigO |
| --------- | ---- |
| lookup    | O(1) |
| push      | O(1) |
| insert    | O(n) |
| delete    | O(n) |

To store Cat, Mouse, Dog and Parrot (total of 4 items), if we are in 32-bit system, that means it takes 4\*4 = 16 bytes of storage.
